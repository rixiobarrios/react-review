# Hello React

Define a simple `<Hello />` component to practice working with props in React.

## Prerequisites

* React
* Create-react-app

## Instructions

Create a react app in this directory (`lib/01-hello`) using `create-react-app`.
Then follow the requirements below.

## Requirements

For this exercise, you're going to build a `<Hello />` component that renders
some data passed in as props.

### Setup

Create a react app in this directory using `create-react-app`. Then create
a file called `Hello.js` in the `src/` directory.

### Function Component

Using a function, define a component called `Hello` that renders an `h1` with
the text `"Hello World"` in it. Update your `<App>` component so that it renders
your new `Hello` component.

### First Prop

Update your component so that it accepts a `name` property. Instead of rendering
`"Hello World"`, your `Hello` component should now render a message with the
value of `name`.

Update your `Hello` component in `App.js` so that you're passing in a name as
a props.
